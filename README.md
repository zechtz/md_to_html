# Markdown to HTML

A simple ruby script that converts all .md files in a specified directory
into html templates.

### Running 
To run the script, just clone the script, move it to your directory with 
markdown files and install RDiscount gem 

`gem install rdiscount`

Next just run the script `ruby convert.rb`

Open up your folder and you will see all markdown files converted into 
html. Of course there are better md to html gems, this was just for experimentation
